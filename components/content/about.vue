    <p>Hello, I'm Krasimir and this is a small single-page app for an exercise purpose.</p>

    <p>The main functionality consists of finding teams in a pre-defined list of items. Every selected team can be followed/unfollowed from the user. The found results must be highlighted. A navigation with the keyboard is possible.</p>

    <p>Please take a look and don't hesitate to contact me if any comments from your side, thank you! :)</p>
